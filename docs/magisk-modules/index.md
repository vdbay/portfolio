# What are Magisk Modules?
{: .no_toc }

Magisk Modules are powerful tools in the Android ecosystem that allow users to modify and customize their device's system without altering the core files. Magisk itself is a systemless rooting solution, which means it modifies the system without tampering with the device's actual system partition, allowing for modifications that can be easily undone or updated.

Magisk Modules extend this functionality by enabling developers and users to apply various system-level tweaks, optimizations, and features, all while maintaining system integrity and compatibility with over-the-air (OTA) updates. This includes anything from performance enhancements and theming options to hardware optimizations and security modifications.

One of the key advantages of Magisk Modules is their versatility and modular nature, allowing for fine-tuned control over specific aspects of the Android system. Whether it's blocking ads, enabling advanced networking options, or tweaking thermal controls, Magisk Modules provide a flexible, non-intrusive way to enhance the Android experience.
